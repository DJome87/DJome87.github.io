Inspectors use a smartwatch app to provide real-time feedback to students during inspections, ensuring they receive detailed insights and can secure suitable accommodations even before arriving in Australia.

            <div class="text-block-18"> According to various reports many international students encounter challenges during their first week in Australia, with some falling victim to scams, misinformation, and exploitation during their initial stay. When they arrive in Sydney and housing turns out to be much worse than advertised or other things go wrong, they’re often not legally protected as tenants and face barriers to getting help

            <div class="text-block-24"><strong>Problem Statement:</strong></div>
            <div class="text-block-18">International students studying in Australia face a complex challenge when seeking accommodations due to various factors. The combination of <strong>miscommunication</strong>, compounded by language barriers, and students’ <strong>unfamiliarity</strong> with the local housing market, creates obstacles that hinder their ability to secure suitable housing options. The <strong>security</strong> and well being of international students need to be ensured by addressing these multifaceted complications. <br>

            <h1 class="heading-33-copy">Gathering insights</h1>
            <div class="text-block-15">As our team is primarily composed of overseas university students with many connections to other stakeholders and personal experiences related to the accommodation search process and its challenges, we figured it would be best to conduct interviews and focus groups to gather insights, as this allows us to take a more personal approach, delve deeper into individual experiences, identify common pain points, and thus develop solutions that better address students' needs.<br><br>
                We conducted interviews with 8 participants and held 4 focus groups, each consisting of international students who have been in Australia for more than a year and have lived in multiple places during their stay. In addition, nterviews were semi-structured, allowing participants to share their unique challenges as we navigate through key themes such as rental application rejections, inspections
                , and bond deposits. <br><br>
                After collecting the recordings from the user interviews and focus groups, 
                I conducted affinity mapping with my teammates to synthesise the pains identified. 
                We grouped these problems under common themes and features in the platform.

        <h1 class="heading-33-copy">Design Approach & Rationale</h1>
        <div class="text-block-15">After gathering research data from surveys and interviews with diabetic patients and health professionals, 
            we concluded that the most appropriate way to address the aforementioned research insights 
            would be through a <strong>mobile app</strong> and a physical <strong>medication dispenser</strong> . </div>
        <div class="text-block-15">Not only are phones accessible to people of all ages, 
            but the mobile app can also serve as a platform 
            that allows both users and their caregivers to 
            monitor the patient's health and medication intake. This facilitates the <strong>social support</strong> 
            and additional <strong>monitoring</strong> necessary for the patient 
            to <strong>establish lifestyle habits</strong> and changes that 
            <strong>increase adherence</strong> to medication and improve the patient’s diabetes management. 
        </div>
        <div class="text-block-15">In addition, the physical medication dispenser would complement the app by integrating real-time connectivity 
            to enable adherence tracking. 
            Its key functions include <strong>automated dispensing</strong>, 
            organizing multiple medications by type, dosage, and time, and 
            providing real-time visual, auditory, and tactile alerts, 
            along with smartphone reminders for missed doses. 
            Additionally, it offers <strong>refill reminders and expiration alerts</strong>, 
            improving medication management beyond standard dispensers. 
            This feature is especially <mark>beneficial for elderly patients</mark>, who represent a significant demographic.</div>
            <div class="text-block-15">Furthermore, a mobile app or website alone is insufficient to effectively address the challenges of diabetes management because diabetes is a condition that requires consistent monitoring, timely medication intake, and behavioral adherence. While digital platforms can provide valuable tracking, reminders, and educational resources, they lack the ability to physically dispense medication or ensure adherence beyond notifications.</div>

                    <br><br> To better accommodate older users and compensate for the lack of elderly participants, we conducted a series of user tests in which participants completed specific tasks under conditions designed to <strong>simulate physical limitations</strong>. For example, we had users wear vision-impairment goggles or hold up a semi-transparent object to evaluate how our product performed under restricted visual conditions. These tests helped ensure that the product is both accessible and functional for users with diverse needs and abilities. </div>

            <h1 class="heading-33-copy">Takeaways & Next Steps</h1>
            <div class="text-block-15">After working on this project for 4 months, our project was selected to be presented in the <mark><a href="https://adpgradshow.com/project/R_4ARS64uAEitVVJ9/">Sydney University Architecture, Design and Planning Graduation Show (2024)</a> </mark>, which was an opportunity to showcase our work to industry professionals, academics, and fellow designers. This recognition not only validated our research and design approach but also allowed us to receive valuable feedback from experts in the field. <br> <br>Some key takeaways from this project are:</div>
            <ul role="list" class="list-8">
                <li><strong>Identifying who your stakeholders are</strong> requires research and a deep understanding of the relationships between the end users, supporting roles, and external influences that impact their experiences and decision making.</li>
                <li><strong>Accessible design is essential</strong> when creating digital products that cater to a diverse range of users, including those with disabilities, elderly individuals, and people with temporary impairments. </li>
                <li><strong>User testing doesn't end after development.</strong> Design is a constant iteration of improving the experience for the end user. Always find ways to collect and listen to your user's feedback.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="text-block-15">
                In future versions of the prototypes, we aim to further refine the physical prototype by 3D printing the model to achieve a more compact and well rounded design, making the device more portable, especially for elderly users or those with limited mobility. Additionally, we plan to improve the dispenser's durability by using higher quality materials, ensuring it can withstand daily use. On the software side, we plan to implement features to enhance accessibility, such as adding Assistive Access, which simplifies the interface and information display. This includes settings to adjust text size, enlarge icons, and integrate voice commands, enabling hands free interaction, which would be helpful for elderly users with mobility, vision, or dexterity issues.
