            <div class="text-block-18"> According to various reports many international students encounter challenges during their first week in Australia, with some falling victim to scams, misinformation, and exploitation during their initial stay. When they arrive in Sydney and housing turns out to be much worse than advertised or other things go wrong, they’re often not legally protected as tenants and face barriers to getting help

            <div class="text-block-24"><strong>Problem Statement:</strong></div>
            <div class="text-block-18">International students studying in Australia face a complex challenge when seeking accommodations due to various factors. The combination of <strong>miscommunication</strong>, compounded by language barriers, and students’ <strong>unfamiliarity</strong> with the local housing market, creates obstacles that hinder their ability to secure suitable housing options. The <strong>security</strong> and well being of international students need to be ensured by addressing these multifaceted complications. <br>

        <div class="section-14 wf-section">
            <h1 class="heading-33-copy">Gathering insights</h1>
            <div class="text-block-15">As our team is primarily composed of overseas university students with many connections to other stakeholders and personal experiences related to the accommodation search process and its challenges, we figured it would be best to conduct interviews and focus groups to gather insights, as this allows us to take a more personal approach, delve deeper into individual experiences, identify common pain points, and thus develop solutions that better address students' needs.<br><br>
                We conducted interviews with 8 participants and held 4 focus groups, each consisting of international students who have been in Australia for more than a year and have lived in multiple places during their stay. In addition, interviews were semi-structured, allowing participants to share their unique challenges as we navigate through key themes such as rental application rejections, inspections
                , and bond deposits. <br><br>
                After collecting the recordings from the user interviews and focus groups, 
                I conducted affinity mapping with my teammates to synthesise the pains identified. 
                We grouped these problems under common themes and features in the platform.

            <li>They seek information primarily through online platforms and social networks, but are more likely to <mark>trust word of mouth and personal recommendations.</mark> </li>
            <li>Most students wish to secure a formal <strong>rental contract</strong> to ensure their rights, but it is <strong>not always guaranteed</strong>. </li>
            <li>In person site inspections are often <strong>mandatory</strong>, but  they can be <strong>difficult</strong> for international students to attend, especially if they are still <strong>abroad</strong>.</li>

        <h1 class="heading-33-copy">Design Approach & Rationale</h1>
        <div class="text-block-15">As reflected in the key findings, some common and recurring issues that overseas students face are <mark>inconvenience, insecurity, and lack of access to information</mark>. In order to better bridge the gap between students and the housing market, it is essential to provide a solution that simplifies the search process, ensures reliable information, and offers <strong>remote access</strong> to property inspections. </div>
        <div class="text-block-15">In addition to having a mobile app with <strong>extensive filters</strong> based on tertiary institutions and <mark>up to date information on housing options and essential facilities</mark> near the selected area, we also sought to address the challenges of arranging inspections and language barriers or miscommunication. 
        </div>
        <div class="text-block-15">To solve these issues, we developed a <strong>smartwatch app</strong> that complements the mobile app by enabling inspectors to provide real-time updates, live feedback, and <mark>detailed insights to students during property inspections</mark>. This ensures that international students, even those overseas, can receive accurate, trustworthy information about potential accommodations without needing to be physically present.<br><br> The smartwatch app facilitates communication between students and inspectors through its <mark>portability and ease of use</mark>, allowing inspectors to efficiently gather and share property information. This, in turn, reduces misunderstandings and enhances the efficiency and accessibility of the inspection process.</div>

        <div class="text-block-21">For the smartwatch live inspection app, the inspector would first decide whether to initiate the inspection. After selecting "start" and accepting the data protection regulations, the app would automatically notify the individual who scheduled the inspection. During the inspection, the interface would remain consistent with the one presented at the <strong>0:08</strong> mark in the video. Once the inspector chooses to conclude the inspection, they would notify the user and await the user's response regarding the inspected property. When the user either accepts or declines the property, the student and inspector can decide whether they wish to continue inspecting other properties.</div>

            <h1 class="heading-33-copy">Challenges</h1>
            <div class="text-block-15">One of the significant challenges we grappled with within the design process, was finding a balance that catered to the diverse cultural and linguistic needs of international students from drastically varied backgrounds. <br><br>
                This required extensive research and a deeper understanding of different cultural perspectives, which was heavily restricted by time constraints. While our team proposed innovative solutions to improve accessibility across cultures, we often found ourselves restricted by the lack of access to as many cultural groups as we had hoped due to the limited time available for testing and design iterations.</div>


            <h1 class="heading-33-copy">Takeaways & Next Steps</h1>
            <div class="text-block-15">Some key takeaways from this project are:</div>
            <ul role="list" class="list-8">
                <li><strong>Focus on building an MVP.</strong> When creating software for platforms that try to bridge cultural gaps, there is only so much time and effort that you can invest, so it's important to focus on the features that can deliver the highest value for your users generally.</li>
                <li><strong>Regular and constant user testings and feedback </strong> are they key to efficient design, and are invaluable in refining a design solution. </li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <div class="text-block-15">
                In the future, we aim to continue collecting user feedback and making iterative improvements. Expanding the app's coverage to serve students in various global locations is another exciting possibility, along with tailoring the app's content for specific regions and increasing outreach as we move forward.
<br><br>
                We also recognise the importance of staying updated with the evolving needs of international students and the housing market. This may involve further collaboration with housing authorities, universities, and student associations to provide the most comprehensive and reliable housing information.
