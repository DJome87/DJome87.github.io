            <div class="text-block-18"> According to the Australian government department of health, there’s 1 in 6 Australians that have some form of hearing loss. That is around 3.6 million people, and among the many people with hearing loss, they tend to experience a drop in self-esteem and are often socially isolated due to their impaired ability to communicate with other people.
            </div>

            <h1 class="heading-33-copy">Gathering insights</h1>
            <div class="text-block-15">As our team explored how to gather insights that would provide the necessary context for designing a solution to our problem, 
                <mark>I identified that our stakeholders were not only just individuals living with diabetes but also <strong>healthcare providers</strong> and  <strong>the elderly</strong> patients they regularly interact with.</mark> 
                 This realisation led me to interview diabetic patients (both Type 1 and Type 2) 
                as well as multiple professionals working in the Australian health sector, including doctors, pharmacists, and physiotherapists. <br><br>
                On one hand, patients shared their firsthand experiences with treatments, challenges, and daily care, 
                while healthcare providers offered clinical insights into treatment options, patient education, and systemic barriers. 
                The two perspectives gives us a more holistic approach to understanding diabetes management, 
                helping us identify key challenges, improve patient support, and develop more effective, 
                practical solutions tailored to both medical and daily life needs. <br><br>
                After collecting the recordings from the user interviews, 
                I conducted affinity mapping with my teammates to synthesise the pains identified. 
                We grouped these problems under common themes and features in the platform.

        <h1 class="heading-33-copy">Design Approach & Rationale</h1>
        <div class="text-block-15">After gathering research data from surveys and interviews with diabetic patients and health professionals, 
            we concluded that the most appropriate way to address the aforementioned research insights 
            would be through a <strong>mobile app</strong> and a physical <strong>medication dispenser</strong> . </div>
        <div class="text-block-15">Not only are phones accessible to people of all ages, 
            but the mobile app can also serve as a platform 
            that allows both users and their caregivers to 
            monitor the patient's health and medication intake. This facilitates the <strong>social support</strong> 
            and additional <strong>monitoring</strong> necessary for the patient 
            to <strong>establish lifestyle habits</strong> and changes that 
            <strong>increase adherence</strong> to medication and improve the patient’s diabetes management. 
        </div>
        <div class="text-block-15">In addition, the physical medication dispenser would complement the app by integrating real-time connectivity 
            to enable adherence tracking. 
            Its key functions include <strong>automated dispensing</strong>, 
            organizing multiple medications by type, dosage, and time, and 
            providing real-time visual, auditory, and tactile alerts, 
            along with smartphone reminders for missed doses. 
            Additionally, it offers <strong>refill reminders and expiration alerts</strong>, 
            improving medication management beyond standard dispensers. 
            This feature is especially <mark>beneficial for elderly patients</mark>, who represent a significant demographic.</div>
            <div class="text-block-15">Furthermore, a mobile app or website alone is insufficient to effectively address the challenges of diabetes management because diabetes is a condition that requires consistent monitoring, timely medication intake, and behavioral adherence. While digital platforms can provide valuable tracking, reminders, and educational resources, they lack the ability to physically dispense medication or ensure adherence beyond notifications.</div>

Not only was the initial scheduling difficult, but conducting additional rounds of user testing was nearly impossible due to time constraints and the health conditions of the elderly patients we had previously tested with.

                    Our main feedback from elderly participants indicated that the user interface was not user-friendly for them and <mark>required greater visual clarity</mark>.  While we wanted to assess our implemented changes and determine whether they improved the interface, we were <mark>unable to arrange further testing sessions with elderly users.</mark> <br>

                    <br><br> To better accommodate older users and compensate for the lack of elderly participants, we conducted a series of user tests in which participants completed specific tasks under conditions designed to <strong>simulate physical limitations</strong>. For example, we had users wear vision-impairment goggles or hold up a semi-transparent object to evaluate how our product performed under restricted visual conditions. These tests helped ensure that the product is both accessible and functional for users with diverse needs and abilities. </div>

                    After working on this project for 4 months, our project was selected to be presented in the 
                    <a href="https://adpgradshow.com/project/R_4ARS64uAEitVVJ9/">
                        <mark>Sydney University Architecture, Design and Planning Graduation Show (2024)</mark>
                    </a>, which was an opportunity to showcase our work to industry professionals, academics, and fellow designers. This recognition not only validated our research and design approach but also allowed us to receive valuable feedback from experts in the field. 
                    <br><br>Some key takeaways from this project are:
    
        
            <ul role="list" class="list-8">
                <li><strong>Identifying who your stakeholders are</strong> requires research and a deep understanding of the relationships between the end users, supporting roles, and external influences that impact their experiences and decision making.</li>
                <li><strong>Accessible design is essential</strong> when creating digital products that cater to a diverse range of users, including those with disabilities, elderly individuals, and people with temporary impairments. </li>
                <li><strong>User testing doesn't end after development.</strong> Design is a constant iteration of improving the experience for the end user. Always find ways to collect and listen to your user's feedback.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="text-block-15">
                In future versions of the prototypes, we aim to further refine the physical prototype by 3D printing the model to achieve a more compact and well rounded design, making the device more portable, especially for elderly users or those with limited mobility. Additionally, we plan to improve the dispenser's durability by using higher quality materials, ensuring it can withstand daily use. On the software side, we plan to implement features to enhance accessibility, such as adding Assistive Access, which simplifies the interface and information display. This includes settings to adjust text size, enlarge icons, and integrate voice commands, enabling hands free interaction, which would be helpful for elderly users with mobility, vision, or dexterity issues.
