                    I'm currently studying a Bachelor of Design Computing üéì at the University of Sydney, set to graduate in May 2025. Throughout my time at university, I've gained a strong understanding of the processes, concepts, and theories of UX/UI and product design, while also honing my technical skills as a creative, coder, and problem solver. 
                    <br><br>
                    I also take a strategic, holistic approach to design and enjoy working on products end to end‚Äîfrom ideation all the way through to development. This portfolio is a reflection of that process, as it is fully designed and developed by me, from start to finish!
                    <br><br>
                    I'm based in Sydney, Australia, and when I'm not designing, I like to hike ‚õ∞Ô∏è, bushwalk üèÉ, swim üèä, play basketball üèÄ, and, lastly, wind down with a game or two of chess ‚ôüÔ∏è when I'm tired of being active all day on my supposed "rest day"~

            <div class="text-block-28">If you don't enjoy what you're doing - move. You are not a tree. Channel your
                energy into something you believe in. I'm fortunate to be inspired and surrounded by motivated people
                who enjoy what they do. We only have so much time on this earth to live - so why waste it?</div>
            <h1 class="heading-42">ü§ì Always be learning. </h1>
            <div class="text-block-28">Humans are constant works in progress that need to receive feedback in order to
                grow. I am always looking at ways to challenge and improve myself, which is why in my spare time I like
                to participate in hackathons, read blogs, dabble in new projects and attend meetups.</div>
            <h1 class="heading-42">üé® Embrace your creativity. </h1>
            <div class="text-block-28">Everyone needs a creative outlet of some sort - else, we'd go insane! When I'm
                not designing, I'm singing with the band, painting artworks as a form of meditation and helping startups
                realise their potential with design.</div>
            <h1 class="heading-42">üôè Stay humble. </h1>
            <div class="text-block-28">It doesn't matter whether you're the president, manager, homeless or average kid
                on the street. Treat others with respect as you would yourself because ultimately we're all human
                sharing the same wants and needs and facing our own battles everyday. Stay true to yourself and stay
                true to others.</div>

            <div class="text-block-28">I've known Gloria now for 8 months and have been genuinely impressed. Gloria has
                joined Sealadder to help build a startup, and in that time, she has taken the lead on a number of areas
                of the business and has been a great sounding board.<br>‚Äç<br>Never afraid to speak her mind, Gloria has
                been able to provide a unique perspective and a clarity of thought that I've found invaluable. But more
                importantly, she has demonstrated on multiple occasions a level of initiative that isn't common amongst
                her peers, organising and taking the lead in meetings with founders and CEOs of potential partner
                companies.<br>‚Äç<br>Gloria's passion to solve the problems of employment and recognition of achievements
                is fundamentally aligned with Sealadder's mission: "‚Äãto promote and provide value to self-education‚Äã".
                Sealadder is a self-education accreditation platform that helps people advance their career, by
                providing goals driven guidance, tracking all learning and providing credibility when applying for a
                job, or promotion.<br>‚Äç<br>Joining any startup is never a step that is taken lightly, especially when it
                requires weekends and working out of hours to bootstrap things together, and demonstrates genuine
                leadership. The most essential element of leadership is having a vision for how to make a difference, to
                make a change for the better or decide where to go. Gloria should be commended for her passion and drive
                to try and make an improvement in the world, in an area that so desperately needs it.<br>‚Äç</div>
